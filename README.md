# Javascript-REST-API-Example
Implement an application in javascript which provides a REST API with endpoints for searching, creating and deleting “server” objects:

Done with the help of Express Route,MongoDB , JavaScript

Start by ->
1) node index or nodemon index
2)mongodb must be running in background
3)index.js api.js and server.js codes are included in the above folder
4)package like body-parser,mongoose,route,express must be saved in directory and imported too

I have used this Json Format:
{
        "_id": "5e93bf7f96081f2ff41da62b",
        "name": "my centos",
        "id": "123",
        "Language": "java",
        "Framework": "Django",
        "__v": 0
}


Look at the Screenshots of Postman for running app.
